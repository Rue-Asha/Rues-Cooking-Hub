# release Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change build-cooking-hub. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: CI workflow
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` SHALL run on pull requests and pushes to `main` with `contents: read` and call
`.github/workflows/gate.yml`: on `["self-hosted","homelab-check"]` for pull requests, on `ubuntu-24.04` for pushes to
`main`. A newer run for the same pull request SHALL cancel the one still running; push runs SHALL NOT be cancelled.
The gate SHALL run `npm ci`, install Playwright Chromium, run `npm run check`, `npm run package`, `npm run test:unit`,
verify the tarball's sha256, run the e2e suite against the unpacked tarball (`E2E_APP_DIR`), and upload the tarball
and checksum as the `release-tarball` artifact; the app SHALL be built exactly once per gate run. `ci.yml` SHALL call
`Rue-Asha/ci/.github/workflows/security-baseline.yml@7b49f3dcf37c61aea3722e68917bc06db507f386 # v1.1.0`. Every
`uses:` SHALL be pinned to a full commit SHA with the version in a comment, using the pins of Rues-Arcade, and
`actions/checkout` SHALL use `persist-credentials: false`. No dependency cache SHALL be used.

#### Scenario: CI is green on the change's PR
- **WHEN** the change's pull request is opened on GitHub
- **THEN** the `ci / ci` job and the `security-baseline` jobs pass and a `release-tarball` artifact is uploaded
- **proof:** manual (runs on GitHub; the change's own PR shows the checks green)

#### Scenario: Push to main runs on a GitHub-hosted runner
- **WHEN** a commit is pushed to `main`
- **THEN** the `ci` job of its run reports the `ubuntu-24.04` runner and uploads `release-tarball`
- **proof:** manual (runs on GitHub after the merge; the run's job page shows the runner)

#### Scenario: Superseded PR run is cancelled
- **WHEN** a second commit is pushed to a pull request branch while its `ci` run is still running
- **THEN** the earlier run ends as cancelled and the new run starts
- **proof:** manual (runs on GitHub; seen when a fixer pushes to the change's own PR, otherwise read from the concurrency block)

#### Scenario: E2E runs against the unpacked tarball
- **WHEN** the gate job runs
- **THEN** its log shows one `vite build`, the e2e step runs with `E2E_APP_DIR` set to the unpacked tarball, and the image tests pass there (sharp loads from the tarball's `node_modules`)
- **proof:** manual (runs on GitHub; read from the change's PR run log)

### Requirement: Dependabot
`.github/dependabot.yml` SHALL check `github-actions` and `npm` weekly and ignore semver-major updates of `typescript`.

#### Scenario: Dependabot config covers actions and npm
- **WHEN** `.github/dependabot.yml` is read
- **THEN** it lists both ecosystems with a weekly schedule and the `typescript` major ignore
- **proof:** manual (configuration; read at Gate 2, dependabot runs on GitHub)

### Requirement: Release workflow
`.github/workflows/release.yml` SHALL run on `v*` tags with the jobs `check-tag` (tag equals `v` + `package.json`
version, the `ci` push run on the tagged commit succeeded, its artifact has not expired), `publish` (download
`release-tarball`, verify the checksum, attest build provenance, `gh release create --generate-notes` with the tarball
and `.sha256`, no rebuild) and `bump` (`Rue-Asha/ci/.github/workflows/bump-pin.yml@7b49f3dcf37c61aea3722e68917bc06db507f386 # v1.1.0`
with `app: rues-cooking-hub`, `host_vars_path: ansible/inventory/host_vars/rues-cooking-hub01/vars.yml`,
`variable: rues_cooking_hub_version`, secrets `HOMELAB_BUMP_APP_ID` / `HOMELAB_BUMP_APP_KEY`).

#### Scenario: Tag does not match the version
- **WHEN** a tag `v9.9.9` is pushed while `package.json` says `0.1.0`
- **THEN** the `check-tag` job fails and no release is published
- **proof:** manual (runs on GitHub on a tag push; not exercised by this change, read from the workflow)

#### Scenario: Release publishes the tested tarball
- **WHEN** tag `v0.1.0` is pushed on the merged `main` commit whose `ci` push run is green
- **THEN** the release holds `rues-cooking-hub-0.1.0.tgz` and its `.sha256` from that run's `release-tarball` artifact, and the release run contains no gate job
- **proof:** manual (runs on GitHub after the ship-time tag push)

#### Scenario: First release bump fails while publish succeeds
- **WHEN** v0.1.0 is released before the Homelab host_vars for `rues-cooking-hub01` exist
- **THEN** the `publish` job succeeds and the `bump` job fails, which is accepted (R4)
- **proof:** manual (runs on GitHub after the ship-time tag push; the run page shows both results)

### Requirement: Release runbook
`docs/release.md` SHALL describe how a release is cut (bump version, merge, tag `v<version>`, artifact expiry after
90 days) and list every outward step this change needs at Ship and after, each marked ⚠: creating the public repo
`Rue-Asha/Rues-Cooking-Hub` with an empty bootstrap commit on `main`, the secrets `HOMELAB_BUMP_APP_ID` /
`HOMELAB_BUMP_APP_KEY`, the `main` ruleset in Life-Manager shape, push/PR/merge/tag, the check01 registration in
Homelab-Managment before the PR, and the Homelab service change after tag v0.1.0 (including nginx
`client_max_body_size 16m` and `BODY_SIZE_LIMIT=16M` for image uploads). The README SHALL link to it.

#### Scenario: Runbook lists the outward steps
- **WHEN** `docs/release.md` is read
- **THEN** it lists each outward step above in order, each with ⚠ and the exact command or setting
- **proof:** manual (documentation; checked by reading the file at Gate 2)

### Requirement: Version 0.1.0
`package.json` and `package-lock.json` SHALL carry version 0.1.0. After the change is merged, tag `v0.1.0` SHALL be
pushed so the release workflow publishes `rues-cooking-hub-0.1.0.tgz` with its sha256.

#### Scenario: Package and lockfile carry 0.1.0
- **WHEN** `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (root and `packages[""]`) are read
- **THEN** all three versions are "0.1.0"
- **proof:** unit

#### Scenario: Release v0.1.0 published
- **WHEN** tag `v0.1.0` is pushed on the merged `main`
- **THEN** the release workflow passes `check-tag` and a GitHub release v0.1.0 holds `rues-cooking-hub-0.1.0.tgz` and its `.sha256`
- **proof:** manual (runs on GitHub after the ship-time tag push)
